To set up and run the Streamlit application, follow the steps below:

i. Create a new environment in Anaconda Navigator and name it "nasenv".
ii. Activate the environment by opening Anaconda Prompt and typing the command conda activate newEnv.
iii. The prompt should now display "newEnv" at the beginning.
iv. Install the Streamlit library in the new environment by running the command pip install streamlit.
v. Install the additional libraries used in the code by executing the command pip install [put_library_name_here] for each library.
vi. The required libraries are "bs4" and "requests".
vii. Once all the libraries are installed, navigate to the directory where your Streamlit code is located using the cd command in the prompt.
For example, if the code is in "C:\Users\DELL\Documents\FINAL_PROJECT_APPLICATION\streamlit_App", type “cd C:\Users\DELL\Documents\ FINAL_PROJECT_APPLICATION\streamlit_App” to change the directory.
viii. Finally, run the Streamlit app in the folder using the command “streamlit run myApp.py”, where "myApp" is the name of the code file in the folder. 
The app will automatically launch in your web browser.
